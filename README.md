# Simple Local RAG Pipeline

This project implements a simple Local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline from scratch using Python and Hugging Face.

## Features

- **Inference**: Utilizes an open-source LLM model from Hugging Face.
- **Frameworks**: Built with PyTorch and NumPy for calculations.
- **Local Execution**: Runs entirely on a local GPU.
- **PDF Processing**: Uses a PDF as the document source.
