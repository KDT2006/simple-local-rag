Building cardiorespiratory endurance  through aerobic exercise is an excellent way to maintain a healthy  weight. Working on this element of physical fitness also improves  your circulatory system. It boosts your ability to supply the body’s  cells with oxygen and nutrients, and to remove carbon dioxide and  metabolic waste. Aerobic exercise is continuous exercise (lasting  more than 2 minutes) that can range from low to high levels of  intensity. In addition, aerobic exercise increases heart and  breathing rates to meet increased demands for oxygen in working  muscles. Regular, moderate aerobic activity, about thirty minutes at  a time for five days per week, trains the body to deliver oxygen more  efficiently, which strengthens the heart and lungs, and reduces the  risk of cardiovascular disease.1 Strengthening your heart muscle  1.

Remember, your ability to  wake up, to think clearly, communicate, hope, dream, go to school,  gain knowledge, and earn a living are totally dependent upon one  factor—your health. Good health allows you to function normally  and work hard to pursue your goals. Yet, achieving optimal health  cannot be underestimated. It is a complex process, involving  multiple dimensions of wellness, along with your physical or  medical reality. The knowledge you have now acquired is also key.  However, it is not enough to pass this nutrition class with good  grades. Nutrition knowledge must be applied to make a difference  in your life, throughout your life.  Throughout this textbook, we have focused on the different  aspects of nutrition science, which helps to optimize health and  prevent disease. Scientific evidence provides the basis for dietary  guidelines and recommendations. In addition, researchers in the  field of nutrition work to advance our knowledge of food production  and distribution. Nutrition science also examines the ill effects of  malnutrition and food insecurity. The findings that are uncovered  today will influence not only what we eat, but how we grow it,  distribute it, prepare it, and even enjoy it tomorrow.

Iron accumulation in certain tissues and organs can cause a host of health problems in children and adults including extreme fatigue, arthritis, joint pain, and severe liver and heart toxicity. In children, death has occurred from ingesting as little as 200 mg of iron and therefore it is critical to keep iron supplements out of children’s reach. The IOM has set tolerable upper intake levels of iron (Table 11.2 “Dietary Reference Intakes for Iron”). Mostly a hereditary disease, hemochromatosis is the result of a genetic mutation that leads to abnormal iron metabolism and an accumulation of iron in certain tissues such as the liver, pancreas, and heart.
